# AHK_Python_Communication_Via_Files

This code will probably not work out of the box

I contains the heart of what I use to have Python and AHK communicate by writing to files and continually checking if files exist.

This allows a near-instantaneous response rate from Python - about an order of magnitude quicker than spinning up a Python interpreter and running a script (which takes my computer about .2 seconds)
